: Oxygen, ₈O

Oxygen is a chemical element; it has symbol O and atomic number 8. It is
a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive
nonmetal, and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most
elements as well as with other compounds. Oxygen is the most abundant
element in Earth's crust, and after hydrogen and helium, it is the
third-most abundant element in the universe. At standard temperature and
pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless
and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O
₂. Diatomic oxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% of the Earth's
atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of
time. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth's crust in the form of
oxides.^([4])

All plants, animals, and fungi need oxygen for cellular respiration,
which extracts energy by the reaction of oxygen with molecules derived
from food and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. In tetrapods
breathing brings oxygen into the lungs where gas exchange takes place,
carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood, and oxygen diffuses into the
blood. The body's circulatory system transports the oxygen to the cells,
where cellular respiration takes place.^([5][6])

Many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain
oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and fats,
as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth,
and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component
of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen is continuously
replenished in Earth's atmosphere by photosynthesis, which uses the
energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide.
Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air
without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of
living organisms. Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O
₃), strongly absorbs ultraviolet UVB radiation and the high-altitude
ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation.
However, ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of smog and thus a
pollutant.

Oxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is
commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl
Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in
Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his
work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen
"dephlogisticated air", and did not recognize it as a chemical element.
The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first
recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the
role it plays in combustion.

Common uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and
textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals,
rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft,
submarines, spaceflight and diving.

History of study

Early experiments

One of the first known experiments on the relationship between
combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century BCE Greek writer on
mechanics, Philo of Byzantium. In his work Pneumatica, Philo observed
that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the
vessel's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the
neck.^([7]) Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the
vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able
to escape through pores in the glass. Many centuries later Leonardo da
Vinci built on Philo's work by observing that a portion of air is
consumed during combustion and respiration.^([8])

In the late 17th century, Robert Boyle proved that air is necessary for
combustion. English chemist John Mayow (1641–1679) refined this work by
showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus
nitroaereus.^([9]) In one experiment, he found that placing either a
mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water
to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before
extinguishing the subjects.^([10]) From this, he surmised that
nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.

Mayow observed that antimony increased in weight when heated, and
inferred that the nitroaereus must have combined with it.^([9]) He also
thought that the lungs separate nitroaereus from air and pass it into
the blood and that animal heat and muscle movement result from the
reaction of nitroaereus with certain substances in the body.^([9])
Accounts of these and other experiments and ideas were published in 1668
in his work Tractatus duo in the tract "De respiratione".^([10])

Phlogiston theory

Main article: Phlogiston theory

Robert Hooke, Ole Borch, Mikhail Lomonosov, and Pierre Bayen all
produced oxygen in experiments in the 17th and the 18th century but none
of them recognized it as a chemical element.^([11]) This may have been
in part due to the prevalence of the philosophy of combustion and
corrosion called the phlogiston theory, which was then the favored
explanation of those processes.^([12])

Established in 1667 by the German alchemist J. J. Becher, and modified
by the chemist Georg Ernst Stahl by 1731,^([13]) phlogiston theory
stated that all combustible materials were made of two parts. One part,
called phlogiston, was given off when the substance containing it was
burned, while the dephlogisticated part was thought to be its true form,
or calx.^([8])

Highly combustible materials that leave little residue, such as wood or
coal, were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible
substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did
not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative
experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on
observations of what happens when something burns, that most common
objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the
process.^([8])

Discovery

[A drawing of an elderly man sitting by a table and facing parallel to
the drawing. His left arm rests on a notebook, legs crossed.]

Joseph Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.

Polish alchemist, philosopher, and physician Michael Sendivogius (Michał
Sędziwój) in his work De Lapide Philosophorum Tractatus duodecim e
naturae fonte et manuali experientia depromti ["Twelve Treatises on the
Philosopher's Stone drawn from the source of nature and manual
experience"] (1604) described a substance contained in air, referring to
it as 'cibus vitae' (food of life,^([14])) and according to Polish
historian Roman Bugaj, this substance is identical with oxygen.^([15])
Sendivogius, during his experiments performed between 1598 and 1604,
properly recognized that the substance is equivalent to the gaseous
byproduct released by the thermal decomposition of potassium nitrate. In
Bugaj's view, the isolation of oxygen and the proper association of the
substance to that part of air which is required for life, provides
sufficient evidence for the discovery of oxygen by Sendivogius.^([15])
This discovery of Sendivogius was however frequently denied by the
generations of scientists and chemists which succeeded him.^([14])

It is also commonly claimed that oxygen was first discovered by Swedish
pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. He had produced oxygen gas by heating
mercuric oxide (HgO) and various nitrates in 1771–72.^([16][17][8])
Scheele called the gas "fire air" because it was then the only known
agent to support combustion. He wrote an account of this discovery in a
manuscript titled Treatise on Air and Fire, which he sent to his
publisher in 1775. That document was published in 1777.^([18])

In the meantime, on August 1, 1774, an experiment conducted by the
British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide
contained in a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named
"dephlogisticated air".^([17]) He noted that candles burned brighter in
the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while
breathing it. After breathing the gas himself, Priestley wrote: "The
feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common
air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for
some time afterwards."^([11]) Priestley published his findings in 1775
in a paper titled "An Account of Further Discoveries in Air", which was
included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and
Observations on Different Kinds of Air.^([8][19]) Because he published
his findings first, Priestley is usually given priority in the
discovery.

The French chemist Antoine Laurent Lavoisier later claimed to have
discovered the new substance independently. Priestley visited Lavoisier
in October 1774 and told him about his experiment and how he liberated
the new gas. Scheele had also dispatched a letter to Lavoisier on
September 30, 1774, which described his discovery of the previously
unknown substance, but Lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it. (A
copy of the letter was found in Scheele's belongings after his
death.)^([18])

Lavoisier's contribution

[A drawing of a young man facing towards the viewer, but looking on the
side. He wear a white curly wig, dark suit and white scarf.]

Antoine Lavoisier discredited the phlogiston theory.

Lavoisier conducted the first adequate quantitative experiments on
oxidation and gave the first correct explanation of how combustion
works.^([17]) He used these and similar experiments, all started in
1774, to discredit the phlogiston theory and to prove that the substance
discovered by Priestley and Scheele was a chemical element.

In one experiment, Lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase
in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container.^([17]) He
noted that air rushed in when he opened the container, which indicated
that part of the trapped air had been consumed. He also noted that the
tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight
of the air that rushed back in. This and other experiments on combustion
were documented in his book Sur la combustion en général, which was
published in 1777.^([17]) In that work, he proved that air is a mixture
of two gases; 'vital air', which is essential to combustion and
respiration, and azote (Gk. ἄζωτον "lifeless"), which did not support
either. Azote later became nitrogen in English, although it has kept the
earlier name in French and several other European languages.^([17])

Etymology

Lavoisier renamed 'vital air' to oxygène in 1777 from the Greek roots
ὀξύς (oxys) (acid, literally "sharp", from the taste of acids) and
-γενής (-genēs) (producer, literally begetter), because he mistakenly
believed that oxygen was a constituent of all acids.^([20]) Chemists
(such as Sir Humphry Davy in 1812) eventually determined that Lavoisier
was wrong in this regard, but by then the name was too well
established.^([21])

Oxygen entered the English language despite opposition by English
scientists and the fact that the Englishman Priestley had first isolated
the gas and written about it. This is partly due to a poem praising the
gas titled "Oxygen" in the popular book The Botanic Garden (1791) by
Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin.^([18])

Later history

Robert H. Goddard and a liquid oxygen-gasoline rocket

John Dalton's original atomic hypothesis presumed that all elements were
monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the
simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton
assumed that water's formula was HO, leading to the conclusion that the
atomic mass of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the
modern value of about 16.^([22]) In 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and
Alexander von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of
hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had
arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on
what is now called Avogadro's law and the diatomic elemental molecules
in those gases.^([23][a])

The first commercial method of producing oxygen was chemical, the
so-called Brin process involving a reversible reaction of barium oxide.
It was invented in 1852 and commercialized in 1884, but was displaced by
newer methods in early 20th century.

By the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied
and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a
cascade method, Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet
evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide in order to liquefy carbon dioxide,
which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. He
sent a telegram on December 22, 1877, to the French Academy of Sciences
in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen.^([24]) Just two days
later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of
liquefying molecular oxygen.^([24]) Only a few drops of the liquid were
produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted.
Oxygen was liquefied in a stable state for the first time on March 29,
1883, by Polish scientists from Jagiellonian University, Zygmunt
Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski.^([25])

[An experiment setup with test tubes to prepare oxygen]

In 1891 Scottish chemist James Dewar was able to produce enough liquid
oxygen for study.^([26]) The first commercially viable process for
producing liquid oxygen was independently developed in 1895 by German
engineer Carl von Linde and British engineer William Hampson. Both men
lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then distilled the
component gases by boiling them off one at a time and capturing them
separately.^([27]) Later, in 1901, oxyacetylene welding was demonstrated
for the first time by burning a mixture of acetylene and compressed O
₂. This method of welding and cutting metal later became common.^([27])

In 1923, the American scientist Robert H. Goddard became the first
person to develop a rocket engine that burned liquid fuel; the engine
used gasoline for fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. Goddard
successfully flew a small liquid-fueled rocket 56 m at 97 km/h on March
16, 1926, in Auburn, Massachusetts, US.^([27][28])

In academic laboratories, oxygen can be prepared by heating together
potassium chlorate mixed with a small proportion of manganese
dioxide.^([29])

Oxygen levels in the atmosphere are trending slightly downward globally,
possibly because of fossil-fuel burning.^([30])

Characteristics

Properties and molecular structure

[]

Orbital diagram, after Barrett (2002),^([31]) showing the participating
atomic orbitals from each oxygen atom, the molecular orbitals that
result from their overlap, and the aufbau filling of the orbitals with
the 12 electrons, 6 from each O atom, beginning from the lowest-energy
orbitals, and resulting in covalent double-bond character from filled
orbitals (and cancellation of the contributions of the pairs of σ and
σ^(*) and π and π^(*) orbital pairs).

At standard temperature and pressure, oxygen is a colorless, odorless,
and tasteless gas with the molecular formula O
₂, referred to as dioxygen.^([32])

As dioxygen, two oxygen atoms are chemically bound to each other. The
bond can be variously described based on level of theory, but is
reasonably and simply described as a covalent double bond that results
from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals
of the individual oxygen atoms, the filling of which results in a bond
order of two. More specifically, the double bond is the result of
sequential, low-to-high energy, or Aufbau, filling of orbitals, and the
resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons, after
sequential filling of the low σ and σ^(*) orbitals; σ overlap of the two
atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the O–O molecular axis and π overlap
of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the O–O molecular
axis, and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two 2p
electrons after their partial filling of the π^(*) orbitals.^([31])

This combination of cancellations and σ and π overlaps results in
dioxygen's double-bond character and reactivity, and a triplet
electronic ground state. An electron configuration with two unpaired
electrons, as is found in dioxygen orbitals (see the filled π* orbitals
in the diagram) that are of equal energy—i.e., degenerate—is a
configuration termed a spin triplet state. Hence, the ground state of
the O
₂ molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen.^([33][b]) The
highest-energy, partially filled orbitals are antibonding, and so their
filling weakens the bond order from three to two. Because of its
unpaired electrons, triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic
molecules, which have paired electron spins; this prevents spontaneous
combustion.^([34])

[]

Liquid oxygen, temporarily suspended in a magnet owing to its
paramagnetism

In the triplet form, O
₂ molecules are paramagnetic. That is, they impart magnetic character to
oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field, because of the
spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule, and the
negative exchange energy between neighboring O
₂ molecules.^([26]) Liquid oxygen is so magnetic that, in laboratory
demonstrations, a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its
own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet.^([35][c])

Singlet oxygen is a name given to several higher-energy species of
molecular O
₂ in which all the electron spins are paired. It is much more reactive
with common organic molecules than is normal (triplet) molecular oxygen.
In nature, singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during
photosynthesis, using the energy of sunlight.^([36]) It is also produced
in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short
wavelength^([37]) and by the immune system as a source of active
oxygen.^([38]) Carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms (and possibly
animals) play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and
converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to
tissues.^([39])

Space-filling model representation of dioxygen (O₂) molecule

The common allotrope of elemental oxygen on Earth is called dioxygen, O
₂, the major part of the Earth's atmospheric oxygen (see Occurrence). O₂
has a bond length of 121 pm and a bond energy of 498 kJ/mol.^([40]) O₂
is used by complex forms of life, such as animals, in cellular
respiration. Other aspects of O
₂ are covered in the remainder of this article.

Trioxygen (O
₃) is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen
that is damaging to lung tissue.^([41]) Ozone is produced in the upper
atmosphere when O
₂ combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of O
₂ by ultraviolet (UV) radiation.^([20]) Since ozone absorbs strongly in
the UV region of the spectrum, the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere
functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet.^([20]) Near
the Earth's surface, it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of
automobile exhaust.^([41]) At low earth orbit altitudes, sufficient
atomic oxygen is present to cause corrosion of spacecraft.^([42])

The metastable molecule tetraoxygen (O
₄) was discovered in 2001,^([43][44]) and was assumed to exist in one of
the six phases of solid oxygen. It was proven in 2006 that this phase,
created by pressurizing O
₂ to 20 GPa, is in fact a rhombohedral O
₈ cluster.^([45]) This cluster has the potential to be a much more
powerful oxidizer than either O
₂ or O
₃ and may therefore be used in rocket fuel.^([43][44]) A metallic phase
was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of
above 96 GPa^([46]) and it was shown in 1998 that at very low
temperatures, this phase becomes superconducting.^([47])

Oxygen dissolves more readily in water than nitrogen, and in freshwater
more readily than in seawater. Water in equilibrium with air contains
approximately 1 molecule of dissolved O
₂ for every 2 molecules of N
₂ (1:2), compared with an atmospheric ratio of approximately 1:4. The
solubility of oxygen in water is temperature-dependent, and about twice
as much (14.6 mg/L) dissolves at 0 °C than at 20 °C
(7.6 mg/L).^([11][48]) At 25 °C and 1 standard atmosphere (101.3 kPa) of
air, freshwater can dissolve about 6.04 milliliters (mL) of oxygen per
liter, and seawater contains about 4.95 mL per liter.^([49]) At 5 °C the
solubility increases to 9.0 mL (50% more than at 25 °C) per liter for
freshwater and 7.2 mL (45% more) per liter for sea water.

Oxygen condenses at 90.20 K (−182.95 °C, −297.31 °F) and freezes at
54.36 K (−218.79 °C, −361.82 °F).^([50]) Both liquid and solid O
₂ are clear substances with a light sky-blue color caused by absorption
in the red (in contrast with the blue color of the sky, which is due to
Rayleigh scattering of blue light). High-purity liquid O
₂ is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied
air.^([51]) Liquid oxygen may also be condensed from air using liquid

Isotopes and stellar origin

Main article: Isotopes of oxygen

[A concentric-sphere diagram, showing, from the core to the outer shell,
iron, silicon, oxygen, neon, carbon, helium and hydrogen layers.]

Late in a massive star's life, ¹⁶O concentrates in the O-shell, ¹⁷O in
the H-shell and ¹⁸O in the He-shell.

Naturally occurring oxygen is composed of three stable isotopes, ¹⁶O,
¹⁷O, and ¹⁸O, with ¹⁶O being the most abundant (99.762% natural
abundance).^([58])

Most ¹⁶O is synthesized at the end of the helium fusion process in
massive stars but some is made in the neon burning process.^([59]) ¹⁷O
is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the CNO
cycle, making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of
stars.^([59]) Most ¹⁸O is produced when ¹⁴N (made abundant from CNO
burning) captures a ⁴He nucleus, making ¹⁸O common in the helium-rich
zones of evolved, massive stars.^([59])

Fifteen radioisotopes have been characterized, ranging from ¹¹O to
²⁸O.^([60][61]) The most stable are ¹⁵O with a half-life of
122.24 seconds and ¹⁴O with a half-life of 70.606 seconds.^([58]) All of
the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than
27 seconds and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than
83 milliseconds.^([58]) The most common decay mode of the isotopes
lighter than ¹⁶O is β⁺ decay^([62][63][64]) to yield nitrogen, and the
most common mode for the isotopes heavier than ¹⁸O is beta decay to
yield fluorine.^([58])

: Ten most common elements in the Milky Way Galaxy estimated
spectroscopically^([65])

Oxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the Earth's
biosphere, air, sea and land. Oxygen is the third most abundant chemical
element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium.^([66]) About 0.9% of
the Sun's mass is oxygen.^([17]) Oxygen constitutes 49.2% of the Earth's
crust by mass^([67]) as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide
and is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust. It is
also the major component of the world's oceans (88.8% by mass).^([17])
Oxygen gas is the second most common component of the Earth's
atmosphere, taking up 20.8% of its volume and 23.1% of its mass (some
10¹⁵ tonnes).^([17][68][d]) Earth is unusual among the planets of the
Solar System in having such a high concentration of oxygen gas in its
atmosphere: Mars (with 0.1% O
₂ by volume) and Venus have much less. The O
₂ surrounding those planets is produced solely by the action of
ultraviolet radiation on oxygen-containing molecules such as carbon
dioxide.

[World map showing that the sea-surface oxygen is depleted around the
equator and increases towards the poles.]

Cold water holds more dissolved O
₂.

The unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on Earth is the result of
the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of
oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the
atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor
of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern
Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere,
while respiration, decay, and combustion remove it from the atmosphere.
In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same
rate.^([69])

Free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world's water bodies. The
increased solubility of O
₂ at lower temperatures (see Physical properties) has important
implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher
density of life due to their higher oxygen content.^([70]) Water
polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may
stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the
decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce the O
₂ content in eutrophic water bodies. Scientists assess this aspect of
water quality by measuring the water's biochemical oxygen demand, or the
amount of O
₂ needed to restore it to a normal concentration.^([71])

Analysis

[Time evolution of oxygen-18 concentration on the scale of 500 million
years showing many local peaks.]

500 million years of climate change vs. ¹⁸O

Paleoclimatologists measure the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the
shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine the climate
millions of years ago (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle). Seawater
molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a
slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier
oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures.^([72])
During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that
evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left
behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then
incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they
would in a warmer climate.^([72]) Paleoclimatologists also directly
measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as
hundreds of thousands of years.

Planetary geologists have measured the relative quantities of oxygen
isotopes in samples from the Earth, the Moon, Mars, and meteorites, but
were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in
the Sun, believed to be the same as those of the primordial solar
nebula. Analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space
and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that the Sun
has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth. The
measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the
Sun's disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust
grains that formed the Earth.^([73])

Oxygen presents two spectrophotometric absorption bands peaking at the
wavelengths 687 and 760 nm. Some remote sensing scientists have proposed
using the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in
those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite
platform.^([74]) This approach exploits the fact that in those bands it
is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its
fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically
difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical
structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method
of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.

Photosynthesis and respiration

[A diagram of photosynthesis processes, including income of water and
carbon dioxide, illumination and release of oxygen. Reactions produce
ATP and NADPH in a Calvin cycle with a sugar as a by product.]

Photosynthesis splits water to liberate O
₂ and fixes CO
₂ into sugar in what is called a Calvin cycle.

In nature, free oxygen is produced by the light-driven splitting of
water during oxygenic photosynthesis. According to some estimates, green
algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the
free oxygen produced on Earth, and the rest is produced by terrestrial
plants.^([75]) Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to
atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower,
suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each
year.^([76])

A simplified overall formula for photosynthesis is^([77])

6 CO₂ + 6 H
₂O + photons → C
₆H
₁₂O
₆ + 6 O
₂

or simply

carbon dioxide + water + sunlight → glucose + dioxygen

Photolytic oxygen evolution occurs in the thylakoid membranes of
photosynthetic organisms and requires the energy of four photons.^([e])
Many steps are involved, but the result is the formation of a proton
gradient across the thylakoid membrane, which is used to synthesize
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via photophosphorylation.^([78]) The O
₂ remaining (after production of the water molecule) is released into
the atmosphere.^([f])

Oxygen is used in mitochondria in the generation of ATP during oxidative
phosphorylation. The reaction for aerobic respiration is essentially the
reverse of photosynthesis and is simplified as

C
₆H
₁₂O
₆ + 6 O
₂ → 6 CO₂ + 6 H
₂O + 2880 kJ/mol

In vertebrates, O
₂ diffuses through membranes in the lungs and into red blood cells.
Hemoglobin binds O
₂, changing color from bluish red to bright red^([41]) (CO
₂ is released from another part of hemoglobin through the Bohr effect).
Other animals use hemocyanin (molluscs and some arthropods) or
hemerythrin (spiders and lobsters).^([68]) A liter of blood can dissolve
200 cm³ of O
₂.^([68])

Until the discovery of anaerobic metazoa,^([79]) oxygen was thought to
be a requirement for all complex life.^([80])

Reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide ion (O⁻
₂) and hydrogen peroxide (H
₂O
₂), are reactive by-products of oxygen use in organisms.^([68]) Parts of
the immune system of higher organisms create peroxide, superoxide, and
singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes. Reactive oxygen species
also play an important role in the hypersensitive response of plants
against pathogen attack.^([78]) Oxygen is damaging to obligately
anaerobic organisms, which were the dominant form of early life on Earth
until O
₂ began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2.5 billion years ago
during the Great Oxygenation Event, about a billion years after the
first appearance of these organisms.^([81][82])

An adult human at rest inhales 1.8 to 2.4 grams of oxygen per
minute.^([83]) This amounts to more than 6 billion tonnes of oxygen
inhaled by humanity per year.^([g])

  : Partial pressures of oxygen in the human body (PO₂)

The free oxygen partial pressure in the body of a living vertebrate
organism is highest in the respiratory system, and decreases along any
arterial system, peripheral tissues, and venous system, respectively.
Partial pressure is the pressure that oxygen would have if it alone
occupied the volume.^([86])

Build-up in the atmosphere

Main article: Geological history of oxygen

[A graph showing time evolution of oxygen pressure on Earth; the
pressure increases from zero to 0.2 atmospheres.]

O
₂ build-up in Earth's atmosphere: 1) no O
₂ produced; 2) O
₂ produced, but absorbed in oceans & seabed rock; 3) O
₂ starts to gas out of the oceans, but is absorbed by land surfaces and
formation of ozone layer; 4–5) O
₂ sinks filled and the gas accumulates

Free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent in Earth's atmosphere before
photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 billion
years ago. Free oxygen first appeared in significant quantities during
the Paleoproterozoic era (between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago).^([87])
Even if there was much dissolved iron in the oceans when oxygenic
photosynthesis was getting more common, it appears the banded iron
formations were created by anoxyenic or micro-aerophilic iron-oxidizing
bacteria which dominated the deeper areas of the photic zone, while
oxygen-producing cyanobacteria covered the shallows.^([88]) Free oxygen
began to outgas from the oceans 3–2.7 billion years ago, reaching 10% of
its present level around 1.7 billion years ago.^([87][89])

The presence of large amounts of dissolved and free oxygen in the oceans
and atmosphere may have driven most of the extant anaerobic organisms to
extinction during the Great Oxygenation Event (oxygen catastrophe) about
2.4 billion years ago. Cellular respiration using O
₂ enables aerobic organisms to produce much more ATP than anaerobic
organisms.^([90]) Cellular respiration of O
₂ occurs in all eukaryotes, including all complex multicellular
organisms such as plants and animals.

Since the beginning of the Cambrian period 540 million years ago,
atmospheric O
₂ levels have fluctuated between 15% and 30% by volume.^([91]) Towards
the end of the Carboniferous period (about 300 million years ago)
atmospheric O
₂ levels reached a maximum of 35% by volume,^([91]) which may have
contributed to the large size of insects and amphibians at this
time.^([92])

Variations in atmospheric oxygen concentration have shaped past
climates. When oxygen declined, atmospheric density dropped, which in
turn increased surface evaporation, causing precipitation increases and
warmer temperatures.^([93])

At the current rate of photosynthesis it would take about 2,000 years to
regenerate the entire O
₂ in the present atmosphere.^([94])

It is estimated that oxygen on Earth will last for about one billion
years.^([95][96])

Extraterrestrial free oxygen

Main article: Extraterrestrial atmosphere

In the field of astrobiology and in the search for extraterrestrial life
oxygen is a strong biosignature. That said it might not be a definite
biosignature, being possibly produced abiotically on celestial bodies
with processes and conditions (such as a peculiar hydrosphere) which
allow free oxygen,^([97][98][99]) like with Europa's and Ganymede's thin
oxygen atmospheres.^([100])

Industrial production

See also: Air separation, Oxygen evolution, and Fractional distillation

[A drawing of three vertical pipes connected at the bottom and filled
with oxygen (left pipe), water (middle) and hydrogen (right). Anode and
cathode electrodes are inserted into the left and right pipes and
externally connected to a battery.]

Hofmann electrolysis apparatus used in electrolysis of water.

One hundred million tonnes of O
₂ are extracted from air for industrial uses annually by two primary
methods.^([18]) The most common method is fractional distillation of
liquefied air, with N
₂ distilling as a vapor while O
₂ is left as a liquid.^([18])

The other primary method of producing O
₂ is passing a stream of clean, dry air through one bed of a pair of
identical zeolite molecular sieves, which absorbs the nitrogen and
delivers a gas stream that is 90% to 93% O
₂.^([18]) Simultaneously, nitrogen gas is released from the other
nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed, by reducing the chamber operating
pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed
through it, in the reverse direction of flow. After a set cycle time the
operation of the two beds is interchanged, thereby allowing for a
continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline.
This is known as pressure swing adsorption. Oxygen gas is increasingly
obtained by these non-cryogenic technologies (see also the related
vacuum swing adsorption).^([101])

Oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into
molecular oxygen and hydrogen. DC electricity must be used: if AC is
used, the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the
explosive ratio 2:1. A similar method is the electrocatalytic O
₂ evolution from oxides and oxoacids. Chemical catalysts can be used as
well, such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are
used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines, and are still
part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of
depressurization emergencies. Another air separation method is forcing
air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxide by
either high pressure or an electric current, to produce nearly pure O
₂ gas.^([71])

Storage

[]

Oxygen and MAPP gas compressed-gas cylinders with regulators

Oxygen storage methods include high-pressure oxygen tanks, cryogenics
and chemical compounds. For reasons of economy, oxygen is often
transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since
one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous
oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 °C (68 °F).^([18]) Such tankers
are used to refill bulk liquid-oxygen storage containers, which stand
outside hospitals and other institutions that need large volumes of pure
oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers, which
convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building.
Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the
compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical
applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting.^([18])

Medical

An oxygen concentrator in an emphysema patient's house

Main article: Oxygen therapy

Uptake of O
₂ from the air is the essential purpose of respiration, so oxygen
supplementation is used in medicine. Treatment not only increases oxygen
levels in the patient's blood, but has the secondary effect of
decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs,
easing work load on the heart. Oxygen therapy is used to treat
emphysema, pneumonia, some heart disorders (congestive heart failure),
some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure, and any
disease that impairs the body's ability to take up and use gaseous
oxygen.^([102])

Treatments are flexible enough to be used in hospitals, the patient's
home, or increasingly by portable devices. Oxygen tents were once
commonly used in oxygen supplementation, but have since been replaced
mostly by the use of oxygen masks or nasal cannulas.^([103])

Hyperbaric (high-pressure) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to
increase the partial pressure of O
₂ around the patient and, when needed, the medical staff.^([104]) Carbon
monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene, and decompression sickness (the
'bends') are sometimes addressed with this therapy.^([105]) Increased O
₂ concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the
heme group of hemoglobin.^([106][107]) Oxygen gas is poisonous to the
anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial
pressure helps kill them.^([108][109]) Decompression sickness occurs in
divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of
inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in the blood. Increasing
the pressure of O
₂ as soon as possible helps to redissolve the bubbles back into the
blood so that these excess gasses can be exhaled naturally through the
lungs.^([102][110][111]) Normobaric oxygen administration at the highest
available concentration is frequently used as first aid for any diving
injury that may involve inert gas bubble formation in the tissues. There
is epidemiological support for its use from a statistical study of cases
recorded in a long term database.^([112][113][114])

Life support and recreational use

[]

Low-pressure pure O
₂ is used in space suits.

An application of O
₂ as a low-pressure breathing gas is in modern space suits, which
surround their occupant's body with the breathing gas. These devices use
nearly pure oxygen at about one-third normal pressure, resulting in a
normal blood partial pressure of O
₂. This trade-off of higher oxygen concentration for lower pressure is
needed to maintain suit flexibility.^([115][116])

Scuba and surface-supplied underwater divers and submariners also rely
on artificially delivered O
₂. Submarines, submersibles and atmospheric diving suits usually operate
at normal atmospheric pressure. Breathing air is scrubbed of carbon
dioxide by chemical extraction and oxygen is replaced to maintain a
constant partial pressure. Ambient pressure divers breathe air or gas
mixtures with an oxygen fraction suited to the operating depth. Pure or
nearly pure O
₂ use in diving at pressures higher than atmospheric is usually limited
to rebreathers, or decompression at relatively shallow depths (~6 meters
depth, or less),^([117][118]) or medical treatment in recompression
chambers at pressures up to 2.8 bar, where acute oxygen toxicity can be
managed without the risk of drowning. Deeper diving requires significant
dilution of O
₂ with other gases, such as nitrogen or helium, to prevent oxygen
toxicity.^([117])

People who climb mountains or fly in non-pressurized fixed-wing aircraft
sometimes have supplemental O
₂ supplies.^([i]) Pressurized commercial airplanes have an emergency
supply of O
₂ automatically supplied to the passengers in case of cabin
depressurization. Sudden cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen
generators above each seat, causing oxygen masks to drop. Pulling on the
masks "to start the flow of oxygen" as cabin safety instructions
dictate, forces iron filings into the sodium chlorate inside the
canister.^([71]) A steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the
exothermic reaction.

Oxygen, as a mild euphoric, has a history of recreational use in oxygen
bars and in sports. Oxygen bars are establishments found in the United
States since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal O
₂ exposure for a minimal fee.^([119]) Professional athletes, especially
in American football, sometimes go off-field between plays to don oxygen
masks to boost performance. The pharmacological effect is doubted; a
placebo effect is a more likely explanation.^([119]) Available studies
support a performance boost from oxygen enriched mixtures only if it is
inhaled during aerobic exercise.^([120])

Other recreational uses that do not involve breathing include
pyrotechnic applications, such as George Goble's five-second ignition of
barbecue grills.^([121])

Industrial

[An elderly worker in a helmet is facing his side to the viewer in an
industrial hall. The hall is dark but is illuminated yellow glowing
splashes of a melted substance.]

Most commercially produced O
₂ is used to smelt and/or decarburize iron.

Smelting of iron ore into steel consumes 55% of commercially produced
oxygen.^([71]) In this process, O
₂ is injected through a high-pressure lance into molten iron, which
removes sulfur impurities and excess carbon as the respective oxides, SO
₂ and CO
₂. The reactions are exothermic, so the temperature increases to
1,700 °C.^([71])

Another 25% of commercially produced oxygen is used by the chemical
industry.^([71]) Ethylene is reacted with O
₂ to create ethylene oxide, which, in turn, is converted into ethylene
glycol; the primary feeder material used to manufacture a host of
products, including antifreeze and polyester polymers (the precursors of
many plastics and fabrics).^([71])

Most of the remaining 20% of commercially produced oxygen is used in
medical applications, metal cutting and welding, as an oxidizer in
rocket fuel, and in water treatment.^([71]) Oxygen is used in
oxyacetylene welding, burning acetylene with O
₂ to produce a very hot flame. In this process, metal up to 60 cm
(24 in) thick is first heated with a small oxy-acetylene flame and then
quickly cut by a large stream of O
₂.^([122])

Compounds

Main article: Oxygen compounds

[Water flowing from a bottle into a glass.]

Water (H
₂O) is the most familiar oxygen compound.

The oxidation state of oxygen is −2 in almost all known compounds of
oxygen. The oxidation state −1 is found in a few compounds such as
peroxides.^([123]) Compounds containing oxygen in other oxidation states
are very uncommon: −1/2 (superoxides), −1/3 (ozonides), 0 (elemental,
hypofluorous acid), +1/2 (dioxygenyl), +1 (dioxygen difluoride), and +2
(oxygen difluoride).^([124])

Oxides and other inorganic compounds

Water (H
₂O) is an oxide of hydrogen and the most familiar oxygen compound.
Hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to oxygen in a water molecule but
also have an additional attraction (about 23.3 kJ/mol per hydrogen atom)
to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule.^([125]) These
hydrogen bonds between water molecules hold them approximately 15%
closer than what would be expected in a simple liquid with just van der
Waals forces.^([126][j])

[A rusty piece of a bolt.]

Oxides, such as iron oxide or rust, form when oxygen combines with other
elements.

Due to its electronegativity, oxygen forms chemical bonds with almost
all other elements to give corresponding oxides. The surface of most
metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized in the presence of
air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the
metal and slows further corrosion. Many oxides of the transition metals
are non-stoichiometric compounds, with slightly less metal than the
chemical formula would show. For example, the mineral FeO (wüstite) is
written as Fe_(1 − x)O[{\displaystyle {\ce {Fe}}_{1-x}{\ce {O}}}], where
x is usually around 0.05.^([127])

Oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of
carbon dioxide (CO
₂). The Earth's crustal rock is composed in large part of oxides of
silicon (silica SiO
₂, as found in granite and quartz), aluminium (aluminium oxide Al
₂O
₃, in bauxite and corundum), iron (iron(III) oxide Fe
₂O
₃, in hematite and rust), and calcium carbonate (in limestone). The rest
of the Earth's crust is also made of oxygen compounds, in particular
various complex silicates (in silicate minerals). The Earth's mantle, of
much larger mass than the crust, is largely composed of silicates of
magnesium and iron.

Water-soluble silicates in the form of Na
₄SiO
₄, Na
₂SiO
₃, and Na
₂Si
₂O
₅ are used as detergents and adhesives.^([128])

Oxygen also acts as a ligand for transition metals, forming transition
metal dioxygen complexes, which feature metal–O
₂. This class of compounds includes the heme proteins hemoglobin and
myoglobin.^([129]) An exotic and unusual reaction occurs with PtF
₆, which oxidizes oxygen to give O₂⁺PtF₆⁻, dioxygenyl
hexafluoroplatinate.^([130])

  Oxygen

  Carbon

  Hydrogen

Among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain
oxygen are (where "R" is an organic group): alcohols (R-OH); ethers
(R-O-R); ketones (R-CO-R); aldehydes (R-CO-H); carboxylic acids
(R-COOH); esters (R-COO-R); acid anhydrides (R-CO-O-CO-R); and amides
(R-CO-NR
₂). There are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen,
including: acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, furan, THF, diethyl
ether, dioxane, ethyl acetate, DMF, DMSO, acetic acid, and formic acid.
Acetone ((CH
₃)
₂CO) and phenol (C
₆H
₅OH) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different
substances. Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are:
glycerol, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, citric acid, acetic anhydride,
and acetamide. Epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a
ring of three atoms. The element is similarly found in almost all
biomolecules that are important to (or generated by) life.

Oxygen reacts spontaneously with many organic compounds at or below room
temperature in a process called autoxidation.^([131]) Most of the
organic compounds that contain oxygen are not made by direct action of O
₂. Organic compounds important in industry and commerce that are made by
direct oxidation of a precursor include ethylene oxide and peracetic
acid.^([128])

Chemical compound

The NFPA 704 standard rates compressed oxygen gas as nonhazardous to
health, nonflammable and nonreactive, but an oxidizer. Refrigerated
liquid oxygen (LOX) is given a health hazard rating of 3 (for increased
risk of hyperoxia from condensed vapors, and for hazards common to
cryogenic liquids such as frostbite), and all other ratings are the same
as the compressed gas form.^([132])

Toxicity

Main article: Oxygen toxicity

[A diagram showing a male torso and listing symptoms of oxygen toxicity:
Eyes – visual field loss, nearsightedness, cataract formation, bleeding,
fibrosis; Head – seizures; Muscles – twitching; Respiratory system –
jerky breathing, irritation, coughing, pain, shortness of breath,
tracheobronchitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome.]

Main symptoms of oxygen toxicity^([133])

Oxygen gas (O
₂) can be toxic at elevated partial pressures, leading to convulsions
and other health problems.^([117][k][134]) Oxygen toxicity usually
begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals (kPa),
equal to about 50% oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2.5 times
the normal sea-level O
₂ partial pressure of about 21 kPa. This is not a problem except for
patients on mechanical ventilators, since gas supplied through oxygen
masks in medical applications is typically composed of only 30–50% O
₂ by volume (about 30 kPa at standard pressure).^([11])

At one time, premature babies were placed in incubators containing O
₂-rich air, but this practice was discontinued after some babies were
blinded by the oxygen content being too high.^([11])

Breathing pure O
₂ in space applications, such as in some modern space suits, or in early
spacecraft such as Apollo, causes no damage due to the low total
pressures used.^([115][135]) In the case of spacesuits, the O
₂ partial pressure in the breathing gas is, in general, about 30 kPa
(1.4 times normal), and the resulting O
₂ partial pressure in the astronaut's arterial blood is only marginally
more than normal sea-level O
₂ partial pressure.^([136])

Oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur
in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving.^([11][117]) Prolonged
breathing of an air mixture with an O
₂ partial pressure more than 60 kPa can eventually lead to permanent
pulmonary fibrosis.^([137]) Exposure to an O
₂ partial pressure greater than 160 kPa (about 1.6 atm) may lead to
convulsions (normally fatal for divers). Acute oxygen toxicity (causing
seizures, its most feared effect for divers) can occur by breathing an
air mixture with 21% O
₂ at 66 m (217 ft) or more of depth; the same thing can occur by
breathing 100% O
₂ at only 6 m (20 ft).^([137][138][139][140])

Combustion and other hazards

[The inside of a small spaceship, charred and apparently destroyed.]

The interior of the Apollo 1 Command Module. Pure O
₂ at higher than normal pressure and a spark led to a fire and the loss
of the Apollo 1 crew.

Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion. Fire and
explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought
into close proximity; an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, is
needed to trigger combustion.^([34]) Oxygen is the oxidant, not the
fuel.

Concentrated O
₂ will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically.^([34])
Steel pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous
and liquid oxygen will act as a fuel; and therefore the design and
manufacture of O
₂ systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are
minimized.^([34]) The fire that killed the Apollo 1 crew in a launch pad
test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure O
₂ but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure, instead of the

1⁄3 normal pressure that would be used in a mission.^([l][142])

Liquid oxygen spills, if allowed to soak into organic matter, such as
wood, petrochemicals, and asphalt can cause these materials to detonate
unpredictably on subsequent mechanical impact.^([34])

    ₂'s partial pressure is the fraction of O
    ₂ times the total pressure, elevated partial pressures can occur
    either from high O
    ₂ fraction in breathing gas or from high breathing gas pressure, or
    a combination of both.

    although some evidence points to an arc from an electrical
    spark.^([141])
